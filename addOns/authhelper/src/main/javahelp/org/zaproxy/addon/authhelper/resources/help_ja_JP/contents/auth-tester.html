<H1>認証テスターダイアログ</H1>

This dialog allows you to test if ZAP can authenticate and automatically handle the session handling
and verification for a site given only the login page and credentials.

<H2>Fields</H2>

The following fields are provided:

<H3>Login URL</H3>
The URL of the login page. It is mandatory and must start with "http://" or "https://".
The URL does not have to be in the Sites Tree, but must be accessible to ZAP.

<H3>コンテキスト</H3>
The name of the context which will be configured to handle the authentication.
If the context already exists then it will be deleted and recreated.

<H3>Auth Method</H3>
The authentication method to use: 
<ul>
<li>Browser Based - ZAP will try to identify and fill in the credentials automatically.
<li>Client Script - ZAP will use the Client Script you have chosen to authenticate.
</ul>

<H3>Client Script</H3>
The script to use for authenticating - this will only be enabled if you have selected the "Client Script" Auth Method.
<p>
If you do not already have a suitable script then you can use the "Record" button - this will launch the selected browser,
start recording your actions and open the specified URL.<br>
You will need to manually close the browser when you have finished.<br>
The script you have just recorded will automatically be selected.

<H3>Browser</H3>
The browser to use for authentication.<br>
The browser you choose will need to be installed and be able to be launched from ZAP.

<H3>Username</H3>
The username to use for authentication - this will only be enabled if you have selected the "Browser Based" Auth Method.<br>
The username and password must be valid for the login to work.

<H3>Password</H3>
The password to use for authentication - this will only be enabled if you have selected the "Browser Based" Auth Method.<br>
The username and password must be valid for the login to work.

<H3>Time to Wait (seconds)</H3>
The number of seconds to wait after submitting the login form before closing the browser.<br>
If the browser is closed before the application has loaded then ZAP may not be able to identify
the session handling or find a suitable verification URL.

<H3>Step Delay (seconds)</H3>

The number of seconds to wait in-between each step, either the implicit steps (filling in the username field, then password, then submitting),
or the ones specified on the Steps tab.<br>
This can help if the target application is running too slowly and does not react in time to handle ZAP's input.<br>
Setting this to 2 will have the same effect as the previous "Demo Mode".

<H3>Record Diagnostics</H3>
Enables the recording of diagnostic data during the authentication. Refer to the <a href="auth-report-json.html">Authentication Report</a> for more details on the diagnostics.

<H3>Reset Button</H3>
The reset button allows you to reset all the fields on the Test tab, and disable all Steps in the Steps tab (steps are only disabled not removed as recreating them might be tedious).

<H2>Results Panel</H2>

The results panel show the progress and what has been identified. All elements need to be identified in order for 
ZAP to be able to automatically handle authentication for this site.

<H2>Diagnostics Tab</H2>

The Diagnostics tab will contain a summary of the requests and responses sent and received as part of the 
authentication testing. It is recommended that you do not perform any other operations in ZAP while testing the 
authentication otherwise that may result in unrelated messages being recorded.
<p>
Only the absolute minimum information is recorded, and host name and parameter values are replaced by safe tokens.
You can copy all of the data and review it to make sure it does not include any sensitive data 
before you share it with us.
<p>
Is ZAP fails to detect either the Username or Password field then we will need more details about the login page.
If you can share that with us then it will it much easier to debug.
<p>
If ZAP detects both of the required fields then please share the data from the diagnostic tab with us - 
we will hopefully be able to diagnose what's going wrong with just that information.
